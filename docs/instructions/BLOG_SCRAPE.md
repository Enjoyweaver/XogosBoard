# Blog Scrape Instructions

## Overview
This document outlines the process to scrape blog posts from the Histronics/Xogos Gaming blog and migrate them to the XogosBoard blog page.

## Source Information
- **Original Blog URL**: https://www.histronics.com/blog
- **RSS Feed URL**: https://www.histronics.com/blog-feed.xml
- **New Domain** (after transfer): https://www.xogosgaming.com/blog
- **Author**: Zack Edwards

## Scraping Method
The blog is built on Wix, which loads content dynamically via JavaScript. The standard page fetch only returns framework code, not actual content.

**Working Method**: Use the RSS feed at `/blog-feed.xml` to extract post metadata:
```
WebFetch URL: https://www.xogosgaming.com/blog-feed.xml
```

After domain transfer, individual posts should be accessible at:
```
https://www.xogosgaming.com/post/[post-slug]
```

## Category Mapping
Posts should be tagged with one of these categories:
- **AI** - All Chapter 1-18 posts (AI education series)
- **Personal Finance** - Chapter 31-32 posts (Debt Free Millionaire financial literacy)
- **History** - Posts about historical topics/figures (none identified yet)
- **Creator's Thoughts** - Any posts that don't fit the above categories

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Domain Transfer
After 48 hours, verify the new domain is active:
```
WebFetch URL: https://www.xogosgaming.com/blog-feed.xml
Prompt: List all blog post URLs and verify they resolve to xogosgaming.com
```

### Step 2: Fetch Full Post Content
For each post, attempt to fetch full content:
```
WebFetch URL: https://www.xogosgaming.com/post/[slug]
Prompt: Extract the full blog post content including: title, publication date, author, and the complete article text/body.
```

If Wix still blocks content, user should copy-paste content manually or export from Wix dashboard.

### Step 3: Update Blog Page
Update `app/blog/page.tsx` with the scraped posts:
- Add each post to the `blogPosts` array
- Use original publication dates
- Assign correct category (AI, Personal Finance, History, Creator's Thoughts)
- Set author as "Zack Edwards"
- Use appropriate images from `/images/` folder

### Step 4: Create Individual Post Pages
The dynamic route at `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` already exists. Add full content to each post in the blogPosts data array.
